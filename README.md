> **Nexus Store** — a world-class, next-generation e‑commerce front-end experience. Designed with pixel-perfect UI, high-performance animations, and a conversion-first UX. Built for modern browsers with accessibility, responsiveness, and delightful motion at its core.


---

## Why Nexus Store?

Nexus Store is not just an e‑commerce UI — it’s an experience layer that blends clean design with purposeful motion and microinteractions to guide users to conversion while maintaining performance and accessibility.

Key design goals:
- Visual hierarchy that communicates product value quickly
- Fast perceived performance through motion and skeleton UIs
- Delightful microinteractions that reward user actions
- Scalable, component-driven architecture for maintainability

---

## Highlights & World‑Class Animation

Nexus Store features an advanced animation system and interaction model designed to feel modern and premium:

- **Entrance choreography** — Hero and product cards animate in with staggered easing for an elegant first impression.
- **Microinteractions** — Add-to-cart, wishlist, and filter toggles include tactile motion and haptic-friendly timing.
- **Smooth page transitions** — Route-aware transitions (push/pop states) reduce jank and preserve context.
- **3D product stage** — Lightweight 3D parallax and subtle rotations (Three.js or CSS 3D fallback) for hero products.
- **Loading UX** — Skeletons and progressive image loading remove layout shift and improve Lighthouse metrics.
- **Accessible animations** — Users with `prefers-reduced-motion` will see simplified, non-distracting transitions.

Recommended animation libraries (used or compatible):
- **GSAP** for complex timelines and orchestration.
- **Framer Motion** (React) for declarative transitions.
- **Three.js** for advanced 3D hero/product previews.
- **Lottie** for lightweight vector animations.
- **AOS** or custom IntersectionObserver for scroll-triggered reveals.

Example CSS snippet for a subtle card entrance animation (replace with library implementation if needed):

```css
.card {
  transform: translateY(18px) scale(.995);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: transform 380ms cubic-bezier(.22,.9,.1,1), opacity 280ms ease;
}
.card.is-visible {
  transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
  opacity: 1;
}
/* Respect prefers-reduced-motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card { transition: none; transform: none; opacity: 1; }
}
```

## Getting Started (Quick)

> These commands assume a Node.js environment. If your project is purely static HTML/CSS, skip the install steps and use the `/dist` or `/public` folder.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nexus-store.git
cd nexus-store

# 2. Install (if using npm project)
npm install

# 3. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 4. Build for production
npm run build

# 5. Preview production build (optional)
npm run preview
```

Scripts (example `package.json`):

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "lint": "eslint . --fix",
  "test": "vitest"
}
```

---

## Folder Structure (suggested)

```
/nexus-store
├─ public/                # static assets, favicon, demo media
├─ src/
│  ├─ components/         # UI components (Header, Footer, ProductCard)
│  ├─ pages/              # Page-level components
│  ├─ styles/
│  │  ├─ _tokens.css      # colors, spacing, typography
│  │  ├─ base.css
│  │  ├─ layout.css
│  │  └─ animations.css
│  ├─ utils/              # helpers, formatters
│  └─ main.js
├─ docs/                  # screenshots, demo gifs, specs
├─ dist/                  # production build (generated)
├─ .github/               # CI workflows
└─ README.md
```

## Design Tokens & Theming

Use CSS custom properties for a single source of truth:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #0b6efd;
  --color-accent: #fb7185;
  --bg: #ffffff;
  --surface: #f7f8fa;
  --radius: 12px;
  --shadow-soft: 0 6px 24px rgba(10,10,10,0.06);
}
```

Provide a `theme.css` file for quick brand swaps (dark mode, seasonal promotions).

---

## Accessibility & Performance

- Proper heading structure and landmark regions
- Alt text on all images and descriptive link text
- Keyboard-first interactions and focus styles
- `aria-live` regions for cart updates
- `loading="lazy"` for offscreen images
- Critical CSS inlined for fastest first paint
- Image optimization pipeline: `srcset` + modern formats (WebP/AVIF)

---

## Testing & Quality

- Linting: ESLint + Stylelint
- Unit tests: Vitest / Jest (UI logic)
- Visual regression: Chromatic or Percy
- Lighthouse: aim for 90+ accessibility and 80+ performance (with images/third-party considered)

---

## Deployment

- Recommended: Vercel or Netlify for zero-config deployment
- GitHub Pages supported for static builds

Example Vercel `vercel.json` (basic):

```json
{
  "builds": [{ "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/static-build" }],
  "routes": [ { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" } ]
}
```

---

## How to Showcase the Animations in README

1. Export a short demo GIF or WebM (4–10s) showing: hero animation, product card hover, add-to-cart microinteraction, and quick checkout flow.
2. Add the file to `/docs/demo.gif` and update the `Demo` section above.
3. Optionally host an autoplay muted WebM in the `docs` folder for better quality and lower size.

2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots
